# STAGE 1

# Project Overview
In the Capstone project, you will build an app of your own design in two stages. In Stage 1, you will design and plan the app, using a template that we provide in the "Instructions" node.
Creating and building your own app idea can be both exciting and daunting; ultimately, we want the experience to be rewarding. You'll apply a wealth of different concepts and components that you've learned across the Nanodegree to bring you own app idea to life.
To keep the process from becoming overwhelming (or simply chaotic), you will design and plan your app, and receive feedback, before you start building. This will help prevent and mitigate pain points you might run into along the way, and also replicates the process of professional Android Developers.

# Why this Project?
To become a proficient Android Developer, you need to design apps and make plans for how to implement them. This will involve choices such as how you will store data, how you will display data to the user, and what functionality to include in the app.

# What Will I Learn?
Through this project, you'll demonstrate the ability to communicate an app idea formally, using:
•	An app description
•	UI flow mocks, similar to what you've seen in other Nanodegree projects, like the Popular Movies overview
•	A list of required tasks that you will complete to build the app, in order
The Capstone project will give you the experience you need to own the full development of an app. This first stage replicates the design and planning experience that proficient Android Developers are expected to demonstrate.

# How Will I Complete this Project?
Supporting Courses
You will learn the skills you need to complete this project in these courses:
•	Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals
•	Advanced Android App Development: Productionize and Publish Your App
•	Google Play Services: Use Google APIs to Improve Your Apps
•	Gradle for Android and Java: Build Better Apps Through Automation

# App Ideas
If you don't have an app idea of your own, feel free to choose one of these:
•	Teleprompter app (we're always on the look-out for a good teleprompter app!)
•	Fitness app
•	Podcast app
•	Travel app
•	Reddit app

# Required Tasks
1.	Review the requirements for the app in this document
2.	Make a copy of this template
3.	Rename the copy: "Capstone_Stage1"
4.	Fill out each section:
5.	App Description
6.	UI Mocks
7.	Key Considerations
8.	Next Steps: Required Tasks
9.	Download the completed document as a PDF, and save it as: "Capstone_Stage1.pdf"
10.	Submit the PDF document in a zip file or from a GitHub repo through the project submission portal.

# Submission and Evaluation
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to this rubric . Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.
Note: Please make sure you clean your project before creating a zip file or pushing code to a GitHub repository. You can clean your project by following the instructions given in this link.
If you are using GitHub to host your projects, please make sure the code you want to submit for review is in the master branch of your repository.
IMPORTANT: If you're submitting via a public Github repository, please make sure any external API key that you utilize, has been removed from your code. It's highly unsafe (and often breaks the Terms of Service) to include API keys in public repos, so you need to remove yours. You can add a note in a README file where a reviewer should go to insert their API key. Reviewers have been trained to expect this situation.
IMPORTANT: Make sure not to forget to move all the hardcoded Strings in your project to the strings.xml file. If you are unsure how to do this, revisit this video in Advanced Android Apps.
When you're ready to submit your project, click on Udacity in the navigation bar at the top your screen to return to your Udacity Home. Then, locate and expand the project you'd like to submit. Click on the button to submit your project. You can view the submission process in more detail here.
If you have any problems submitting your project, please email us at android-project@udacity.com. Due to the high volume of submissions, the turnaround for your project can take up to a week.
Each Android ND project will be reviewed against the Common Project Requirements, in addition to its project-specific rubric.

# Stage 2

# Project Overview
In Stage 1, you designed and planned your Capstone app. Now, it's time to build it!
Nanodegree students must successfully complete the Capstone, Stage 1 project prior to beginning Stage 2.

# Why this Project?
In this project, you will demonstrate the skills you've learned in your Nanodegree journey, and apply them to creating a unique app experience of your own. By the end of this project, you will have an app that you can submit to the Google Play Store for distribution.

# What Will I Learn?
The Capstone project will give you the experience you need to own the full development cycle of an app.
